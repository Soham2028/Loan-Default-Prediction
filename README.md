# Loan Default Prediction

## Problem Statement

A loan is one of the most important products of the banking. All the banks are trying to figure out effective business strategies to persuade customers to apply their loans. However, there are some customers behave negatively after their applications are approved. To prevent this situation, banks have to find some methods to predict customers’ behaviors. Machine learning algorithms have a pretty good performance on this purpose, which are widely used by the banking.
The data set is based upon Lending Club Information – The Irish Dummy Banks is a peer to peer lending bank based in Ireland, in which bank provide funds for potential borrowers and bank earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). Irish Fake bank provides loan to their loyal customers.
Proposed techniques and data science methodology
We intend to perform several algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree and random forest to classify the data into a good loan application & a bad loan application in order to predict which application to grant to. We would also like to compare the accuracy of these models to determine which would be the most suitable for this kind of prediction.
A Few Business Questions intended to analyze
1. Classifying an application as a good or a bad loan application
2. Determining the correlation between 2-year delinquent and the loan condition
3. What are the major reasons for a loan application?

## Dataset
The data set is based upon Lending Club Information – The Irish Dummy Banks is a peer to peer lending bank based in Ireland, in which bank provide funds for potential borrowers and bank earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). Irish Fake bank provides loan to their loyal customers. This clean dataset has been chosen from Kaggle. This dataset has 887k rows and 30 columns.

## Introduction
As a bank, you would like to give as many loan applications as possible and hope that everyone pays back the loan with a good interest amount. This is the most likely scenario in an ideal world. As we do not live in an ideal world, few customers may not pay the loan amount as per we like. So, using Machine Learning Algorithms we are trying to find if there are any factors that help us find the customers that do not repay the loan.
The data set is based upon Lending Club Information – The Irish Dummy Banks, which is a peer to peer lending bank based in Ireland, in which this bank provides funds to potential borrowers and the bank earns a profit depending on the risk it takes (the borrowers credit score). Irish Fake bank provides loan to their loyal customers. The complete data set is borrowed from Lending Club and few details might have been changed for confidential purpose. This dataset is copied and clean from Kaggle, but it has been changed by the uploader. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
